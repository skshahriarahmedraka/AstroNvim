# AstroVim Configuration

This project is a customized configuration for Neovim, based on the [AstroVim](https://astrovim.com/) distribution. The configuration is written in Lua and managed using the [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager.

## Key Files and Directories

- `init.lua`: The main entry point for the Neovim configuration.
- `lua/lazy_setup.lua`: Configures the `lazy.nvim` plugin manager itself.
- `lua/plugins/`: This directory contains the configuration for most of the plugins. Each file typically returns a Lua table that follows the `lazy.nvim` specification for a plugin.
  - To add a new plugin, you can create a new file in this directory.
  - To configure an existing plugin, you can modify its corresponding file.
- `lua/community.lua`: Used to enable and configure plugins from the AstroVim community repository.
- `lua/config/keymaps.lua`: Defines custom keybindings.
- `lua/polish.lua`: A file for final tweaks, overrides, and `vim.opt` settings after all plugins have been loaded.
- `lazy-lock.json`: The lockfile generated by `lazy.nvim`. **Do not edit this file manually.** It is managed automatically by `lazy.nvim`.
